## Use “container-on-demand” to run MySQL

- Ask for container `Ubuntu 18.04 - Python 3.7`
- Connect via SSH
- Or via the WebTerminal
- In the container, you should start MySQL before playing with it:

```bash
service mysql start
 * MySQL Community Server 5.7.30 is started
$
$ cat 0-list_databases.sql | mysql -uroot -p my_database
Enter password: 
Database
information_schema
mysql
performance_schema
sys
$
```
### In the container, credentials are root/root

## How to import a SQL dump

```bash
$ echo "CREATE DATABASE hbtn_0d_tvshows;" | mysql -uroot -p
Enter password: 
$ curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/holbertonschool-higher-level_programming+/274/hbtn_0d_tvshows.sql" -s | mysql -uroot -p hbtn_0d_tvshows
Enter password: 
$ echo "SELECT * FROM tv_genres" | mysql -uroot -p hbtn_0d_tvshows
Enter password:
